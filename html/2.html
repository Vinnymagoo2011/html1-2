        <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
        <p1>HTML is a way to create an old fashioned homemade website. <i>You</i> can even do it! That's what I used to make this one! To publish your website, you can find a tutorial on Youtube. I would search for tutorials for GitHub. GitHub is really easy and uncomplicated. That's most likely what I'm gonna use to publish this one. There are also other tutorials for other HTML type codes called CSS and JavaScript. Same concept I think. I only know HTML. Hope this helped!</p>
